JavaScript Form Validator

In this assignment you will create a complete content page for a website. This can be an actual website that exists, one you want to create, or one that you've simply made up for the purpose of this work. 

Your page will use JavaScript to enhance the user experience, leveraging all of the skills we have been practicing this quarter. Your code should be well-written and reflect an understanding of foundational principles in JavaScript. You are allowed to make use of third-party elements for media resources (images, audio, video, etc.), CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap or others), or JS modules, but you will need to write a solid bit of JavaScript yourself, too.

It is STRONGLY recommended to pull back on the number of features in your page and focus on writing everything from scratch WITHOUT using third-party tools or helpers. Consider writing code to allow you to make tabbed content, or code to allow you to do show/hide of content easily, or code to make some other interface enhancement. Consider putting together several small features to build an interactive page. You could make some kind of tool or some kind of game or some other sort of app.

What is crucial about this assignment is that you demonstrate your mastery of basic JavaScript. Focus on the details, get everything right, and minimize the extra bells and whistles. This approach will give you the best experience and the most valuable portfolio piece.

Basic Requirements
In order to fulfill the requirements of this assignment you must:

Write standards-compliant JS that functions.
Make use of both Array and Object data structures.
Make use of at least TWO conditional statements that play a significant role in your code.
Make use of either Functions or Classes to organize your code.
Make use of at least TWO Event listeners and handlers to respond to user interaction.
Perform at least TWO string modifications/replacements on the page.
Leverage proper DOM traversal and understanding of hierarchy to facilitate manipulating the page to enhance the user's experience.
 

Stretch Goals
If the Basic Requirements do not provide enough challenge, try these goals:

Write a Class-based feature that you can re-use throughout the page.
Dive into the large world of JS modules and write code that leverages a third-party JS library in an interesting way.
Create a game.
